# Bar Gelateria Oasi

## Code Institute:Milestone Project 1
![Bar Gelateria Oasi Responsive Design](https://github.com/Nicola2309/MS1/blob/master/assets/img/READMEimgs/Responsive-readme-img.png)

*Bar Gelateria Oasi* is a real bar opened in my home village.
The reason that moved me to make its website is linked to my work experience, that started in that bar when I was 16,
and I wanted to create a website that is personalized and consistent with the story of the company and its products
in a way that could be relevant for the customers and with a simple structure easy to navigate in.

As a greedy internet user I really love the encounter with simple and complete websites going straight to the point of my needs 
and curiosities.
Thanks to what I learnt during the *Code Institute* course and following the advices of my mentor, Seun Owonikoko,
I kept a consistent design and structure of the content using the learnt languages HTML5,CSS3 and adding a few lines of JS to have a clearer navbar during the navigation
through the readable content.
The goal was to complete a responsive and interactive website based on the User Experience principles.

This was the first of four Milestone Projects in the Full Stack Web Development Program I am attending at *The Code Institute*.

## UX

### Main aims

- To create a website that is speaking directly to the viewer, giving a clear idea and description of the company.

- To make the website interactive through a form that allows customers with special needs to explain themselves. 

- To make it easy for mobile users which visit the bar during the Virus Times, making possible for them to tap on the shopping-cart that brings them to the Menu page, choose the products, so the company can avoid to provide printed Menu's of common use.

- To create a responsive design fitting all devices and screen sizes.


### Customers' Reviews
- The Customers' Reviews motivated me to create a website that transmitted the same enthusiasm people have when visiting the company.

#### New Customers Comments

- It is the first time I come to Bolsena and found this Bar on the lakefront walk, amazing icecream, and professional service.

- I live in a little village far away from the bigger ones, but when I asked the owner if it was possible to have things delivered anyway he adjusted the
  delivery route and found a day of the Week to come to my house, awesome!

#### Regular Customers Comments

- I often come to Bolsena and have a walk on its beautiful lakefront. I always stop at Bar Oasi, I find the icecream and drinks just amazing here. And now, I can order what I want directly from its website!
- I needed a special birthday cake for my daughter. Since I can always rely on Bar Oasi, I contacted them through the website to ask for a personalized cake for her, it was as beautiful as delicious!

#### Tablet User

- I browse the web with my iPad, I liked that this website is well proportioned and that i could access the Menu's through a pdf links, which i could download and keep with me.

### Design Process

1. Strategy plane: I started based on the need to tell the full story of a company making use of my experience as a worker, as a customer and as an internet user. The UX experience was entirely focused on non-expert internet users, and making them possible to orientate themselves in a simple design and provide them the service they wanted, my older relatives were my model.

2. Scope plane: Once decided the users I wanted to be able to reach, I followed the instructions in the course and of my mentor to create a consistent website that could be simple and reliable to navigate : making every page with a similar central opening picture, well structured and consistent widths of the sections, to achieve a smooth scrolling of the content and a form to satisfy special occasion needs.

3. Structure plane: When I knew wich features I wanted for the website I decided to create the pages: 'Home', to welcome the customer with a story of the product and the company's experience. 'Abou Us' to provide a background history of the staff and the company, plus the customers' comments about the company, I found it logic. 'Menu&Delivery' to store Menu's and different products pictures. 'Contacts' to actually contact the company for general questions or specific needs.

4. Skeleton Plane: Since the website had to be simple to navigate, I opted for a sticky navbar. Thinking about simplifying i came up with the idea of the shopping-cart for mobile users and its specific function.

5. Surface Plane: 
    * To achieve my goals I knew I had to impress the user with nice image and create short pages that don't require much time and effort to scroll and absorb their content. With this idea my will was to avoid losing the user attention in text walls or into too colourful layouts that demands cognitive effort to be processed, effort that most people are not interested in using for a company website. 
    * I started a wokspace on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/jc8QKDwQCQ1ecvrTFuogfB/MS1?node-id=12%3A0) to experiment my ideas with my wireframe.
    * Next came the need to find a compatible pair of fonts on Google Fonts. I searched for fonts to give a sense of confidence and clarity to the text without appearing too formal. I opted for Montserrat for the content and Oswald for the titles.
    * Once the Wireframe was clear enough to start coding around it I began experimenting structures and layouts. This tool has been fundamental to remind the structure I thought for the website and get back to it everytime the variations thought in the coding process were exceeding the limit.

## Features

### Existing Features

This project consists of 4 pages accessible from both the navbar and the footer.

#### Consistent features across all pages

- The navbar menu at the top and footer at the bottom of the page are consistent and responsive throughout the website.
- Each page starts with a central image of a fixed width.

#### Home

- The user sees an icecream on a fresh fruit plate with a green background, having clear what's the center of the website.
- The user reads then the evolution of the product in years of work and experience.
- In the last section the characteristics and Philosophy of the company are summed up in 4 points. The user can continue the navigation from the footer or the navbar.

#### About Us

- The welcoming picture is a sunny icecream showcase.
- The user sees then a picture of the team and a brief story of the company.
- The user can read quotes of regular customers.

#### Menu&Delivery

- The welcoming picture is a takeaway icecream box with the showcase in the back.
- The user sees then three clickable menu's in pdf, to open and choose what's desired.
- Scrolling, the user can see three pictures representing three moments of the customer, who can eat something special alone, with the partner, with family/friends.
- The final section is occupied by two simplified menu's for delivery options.

#### Contacts

- In the welcoming picture the user sees a girl about to contact someone.
- The user can find the average contacts spreaded in the whole site through the footer, and a form. 
- The form's purpose is to fulfill special users needs, wich the user can explain directly to the company.

### Features Left to Implement

- A future feature could be adding an extra page informing the user about the Events the company intends to host.

- Implementing deliveries means having routes, and Google Maps link with the names of the cities reached by the delivery service.

- A feature i didn't succed in implementing has been the Datetime Picker from bootstrap, it requires some JavaScript and i am not currently able to use it properly and effectively.

- A linear gradient to copy the colors of the logo's icecream on the icons in the Homepage and the clickable menu's. With tutoring suggestion i found the option of the polyfill to make the changes work on different browsers, but Javascript experience is required, so i just changed the color for now.
